1. Java Programming & OOPs
Java is the foundational language for the automation questions listed in the document.

Difference between Abstract Class and Interface?
Abstract Class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods. It supports state (instance variables) and is used when objects share a common base.
Interface: Traditionally only had abstract methods (now supports default/static). It defines a contract of "what" a class can do, not "how."
 
 
 

What are the OOPs pillars?
Encapsulation: Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together.
Inheritance: One class acquiring properties of another.
Polymorphism: One task performed in different ways (Overloading vs. Overriding).
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality.
 
 
 

Can multiple inheritance be implemented in Java?
No, Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid the "Diamond Problem," but it can be achieved through Interfaces.
 
 
 

Why are Strings immutable in Java?
For security, caching (String Pool), and synchronization. Once created, their value cannot be changed.
 

Compile-time vs. Runtime Exceptions?
Compile-time (Checked): Checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
Runtime (Unchecked): Occur during execution (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).
 
 
 
 
2. Selenium Automation
These questions focus on interacting with web elements and handling browser behavior.

Difference between findElement() and findElements()?
findElement() returns a single WebElement and throws NoSuchElementException if not found.
findElements() returns a List<WebElement> and returns an empty list if no elements match.
 
 
 
 

Why is CSS Selector often preferred over XPath?
CSS Selectors are generally faster and have better performance across different browsers, though XPath is more powerful for traversing the DOM (like moving from child to parent).
 
 
 
 
 

How do you handle dynamic web elements?
By using dynamic XPaths (functions like contains(), starts-with(), or following-sibling) and implementing Explicit Waits.
 
 
 

What are the different types of Waits in Selenium?
Implicit Wait: Sets a global timeout for the driver to wait for elements.
Explicit Wait: Waits for a specific condition (e.g., elementToBeClickable).
Fluent Wait: Similar to explicit wait but allows setting the polling frequency.
 
 
 
 

How to handle Alerts and Iframes?
Alerts: driver.switchTo().alert().accept() or dismiss().
Iframes: driver.switchTo().frame(index/id/name).
 
 
 
3. Manual Testing & Agile
This section covers the theoretical framework of software quality assurance.

Explain the Defect Life Cycle.
It is the journey of a bug from discovery to closure: New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Closed (or Rejected/Deferred).
 
 
 

Severity vs. Priority?
Severity: The impact of the bug on the system (e.g., a crash is High Severity).
Priority: How quickly the bug needs to be fixed (e.g., a typo on the home page logo is High Priority but Low Severity).
 
 
 
 

Smoke vs. Sanity Testing?
Smoke: Done on initial builds to check if the "critical" features work.
Sanity: Done on stable builds to verify specific bug fixes or changes.
 
 
 
 

What are Agile Ceremonies?
Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
 
4. TestNG Framework & POM
These topics relate to how you structure and execute your automation scripts.

What is the Page Object Model (POM)?
A design pattern that creates an object repository for web elements, separating the test logic from the page UI structure to improve maintenance.
 
 

What is the use of @PageFactory?
It is an extension of POM used to initialize web elements using the @FindBy annotation.
 

How do you control test execution order in TestNG?
By using the priority attribute in the @Test annotation (e.g., @Test(priority = 1)).
 
 
 

How to achieve parallel test execution?
By setting the parallel attribute to methods, tests, or classes in the testng.xml file.
 
5. Modern Tools (Git, Jenkins, GenAI, SQL)
Questions regarding the CI/CD pipeline and data management.

What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
A continuous process of integrating code changes (CI) and deploying them automatically to environments (CD) using tools like Jenkins.
 
 
 


Difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE?
DELETE: DML command; removes specific rows (can be rolled back).
TRUNCATE: DDL command; removes all rows (faster, cannot be rolled back easily).
DROP: DDL command; removes the entire table structure and data.
 
 
 

How have you integrated AI/GenAI in your project?
Common Answer: Using GenAI for generating test data, summarizing defect reports, or helping write boilerplate automation scripts and complex XPaths.
 
 
 
Coding Challenges Mentioned:
The document frequently highlights these specific programs you should be ready to write:

Reverse a String (e.g., "Automation").
 
 

Palindrome Number/String.
 
 

Find Duplicates in a String.
 

Prime Number check.
 

Maximum Number in an Array.
